short program for analyzing the number of euqations needed to describe the image of the veronese embedding... 
veronese.cpp uses int for the vectors. I thought "why not save some memory if i use small numbers anyway" so that's why veronese_short.cpp exists.
i stopped working on veronese.cpp, so all fun and relevant data is in veronese_short.cpp
